## 1. What Tcash Does

Tcash is a World App mini app that bridges WLD and USDC crypto with Kenyan M-Pesa mobile money. Users can:

- **Buy** WLD or USDC by paying KES via M-Pesa PayBill — order confirmed by admin, crypto sent to World wallet
- **Sell** WLD or USDC by sending from World App via World Pay — admin settles KES to the user's M-Pesa number
- **Track** all orders in real time with status updates and World push notifications
- **Invite** other World users with a referral code and earn KES rewards when friends trade

The service is fully manual-review based — no automated on-chain settlement. All payouts are processed by the admin operator.

## 3. MiniKit Commands Used

| Command | Where | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `walletAuth` | LoginPage | Sign in with World wallet — full SIWE flow with server nonce |
| `pay` | SellPage | In-app WLD/USDC send to Tcash receiver wallet |
| `requestPermission` | AppShell | Request notification permission on first entry |
| `getPermissions` | AppShell | Check existing notification permission state |
| `sendHapticFeedback` | All pages | Feedback on button taps, order confirmation, saves |
| `closeMiniApp` | AppShell Exit | Gracefully close the mini app on logout |
| `share` | Dashboard / Profile | Share referral invite link |

All commands are called via `MiniKit.commandsAsync` (documented async API). Every command has a graceful fallback for browser preview mode outside World App.

## 4. Backend API Routes (Vercel Serverless)

All routes live under `/api/` and run as Vercel Node.js functions.

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/nonce` | GET | Create HMAC-signed server nonce for SIWE |
| `POST /api/complete-siwe` | POST | Verify World wallet auth payload server-side |
| `POST /api/payment-reference` | POST | Issue a unique payment reference before World Pay |
| `POST /api/confirm-payment` | POST | Confirm World Pay transaction with Developer Portal API |
| `GET /api/orders` | GET | Load orders — admin sees all, a user sees only their own (Upstash Redis, Vercel Blob fallback) |
| `POST /api/orders` | POST | Save a new/updated order; enforces ownership, admin-only status writes, and the World ID high-value gate |
| `GET /api/admin-session` | GET | Report whether the SIWE session wallet is a recognised operator |
| `POST /api/notify-admin` | POST | Admin notifications — Resend email (order or referral) or World push, by payload shape |
| `GET /api/settings` | GET / POST | Read live fee/operational settings (public GET); admin-only writes |
| `GET /api/referral-claims` | GET / POST | Referral payout queue — admin-only reads, ownership-checked writes |

| `GET /api/world-prices` | GET | Fetch live WLD/USDC/KES rates (World public feed, with Binance/CoinGecko fallback) |
| `GET /api/health` | GET | Backend health check — reports which env-gated features are configured |

## 8. Security

| Area | Implementation |
|---|---|
| SIWE nonce | HMAC-SHA256 signed with `DEV_PORTAL_API_KEY`, cookie + signature dual validation |
| Payment reference | Server-issued UUID stored in httpOnly cookie, verified on confirm |
| Timing-safe comparison | `timingSafeEqual` used for nonce signature check |
| Admin route | Password-gated locally — `/tcash-admin`, `/tmpesa-admin`, `/admin` all resolve to AdminPage |
| CORS | `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on `/api/*` for World App WebView |
| Security headers | `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `Referrer-Policy` |
| Blob storage | Public read (order blobs are non-sensitive), write requires `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` |

---

## 9. Known Limitations (Prototype)

- **Manual settlement** — All KES payouts and crypto releases are processed manually by the admin.
- **Local user storage** — User accounts stored in browser localStorage. No cross-device sync (World wallet address provides de-facto identity).
- **Single admin desk** — One operator manages all orders.
- **Receiver wallet whitelisting** — World Developer Portal requires the sell receiver wallet (`0x6588e8…`) to be whitelisted before live World Pay transactions are accepted.
- **Resend free tier** — Email notifications limited to 100/day. Upgrade plan for production volume.
